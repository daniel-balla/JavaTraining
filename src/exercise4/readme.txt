I created this small application, which manages our employees.
Sometimes I get some weird bugs, for which I implemented this logger, 
with which I was able to trace down the bug.
Since I added this logging, the application is way to slow, even if logging is disabled.
Please have a look at the Logger class, maybe you can find a way to get it quicker.

It is really important that the Application Logic stays the same,
you're only allowed to change the Logger class and the logging statements!
